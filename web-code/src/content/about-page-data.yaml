        Hi! Welcome to my website. From when I was young I liked to be creative 
        or do sports. My room changed every week and I loved watching television 
        shows about interior design. On my high school I started making my own website 
        and made posters for events. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I studied Multimedia, Concepting and Design at the Hanzehogeschool in Groningen. 
        In my third year I went to Denmark to follow a specialisation in UI design. 
        This was a great experience where I learned a lot. My graduation project for my 
        bachelor was designing an app with Augmented Reality. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        After my bachelor I got selected for the Master Digital Design in Amsterdam, 
        where I graduated with a project for people with breast cancer to make them feel more in control. 
        Together with only 24 international students I developed myself further as a 
        Digital Designer through big projects, guest lectures from designers all over the 
        world and much more. 
        <br>
        <br>
        With all the knowledge I had from my studies I started working full-time as a 
        Digital Designer at the Factor.e. Together with different teams I developed websites, 
        apps, dashboards and more mostly for big companyâ€™s in education and healthcare. 
        Noorderpoort, Alfa college, UMCG, SEIN, excap etc. 
        <br>
        <br>
        When I'm not doing creative things, 
        changing my interiur, I love to do sports. Be in my body and move. 
        I'm also interested in (mental) health and sustainability.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now I am searching for a job! I would like to work for a company where 
        I can show my creative ideas and design User Interfaces. 
        Please feel free to <a href="mailto:info@saskiawijnstra.nl" target="_blank">contact</a> 
        me if you want to get to know me better.
