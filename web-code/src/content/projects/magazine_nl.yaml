          In the second year of the Multimedia, Concepting and Design program, 
          we had to make a magazine about ourselves. On this page you can see the result 
          of this project. The magazine had to have a mean subject that has something 
          to do with yourself. For this I chose list-maker. I make lists of many things 
          to keep the overview. I have implemented this in my magazine.
