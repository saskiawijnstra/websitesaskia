          G-Force Capital is an investment fund for start-ups where 'ICT' or 'digital' 
          is the core of their proposition. The G in G-Force stands for Groningen. 
          The investment fund stands for honest, transparent, fast, clear, 
          down-to-earth and northern. I tried to process this as much as possible in 
          the logo and the website.

          During the start of G-Force Capital there was a big opening to reveal the logo and website. 
          It was a really fun day with investors, start-ups, colleagues and more.
