          I designed the logo and the website for FysioVries. 
          I made all the photos on the website myself. The website had to 
          be clear for young and old users. The most important information 
          is on the home-page in the four boxes and on the other pages is 
          in-depth text. I have built it as clear and clean as possible 
          with fresh colors and photography.
