          I got asked by a developer to design an app 
          where he could find all the discounts from all the supermarkets 
          in the Netherlands. He would do the coding and for the app he needed 
          a designer to make his idea visual, understandable and logic. 
          <br><br>
          For the design I chose light colours and an open, easy to read font. 
          The price and important information in red to get your attention. 
          The background is slightly blue to make it calm and get your 
          attention to the products. What I really liked about designing 
          this app was how can I make it as clean and clear as possible, 
          with all the sale variations and texts that needed to be in there.

          For the design I thought about nice features to have in the app. 
          For example to select the different supermarkets you go to or get 
          a notification if something is for sale that you really want. 
          I also prototyped the scrolling in the pages and how the 
          transitions between the pages worked. To make it logic for 
          the user where you are in the app. The app is in the play store. 
          You can download it yourself. Under here you can find the final designs I made.
