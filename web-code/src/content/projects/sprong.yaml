          People with breast cancer who follow a supervised exercise program 
          during chemotherapy can preserve their physical fitness, limit fatigue 
          and other symptoms, and increase the chance of chemotherapy completion.
          At the Onconet in the VUmc they give these supervised exercise programs, 
          also oncofysio called. Right now the physiotherapists and patient have 
          papers where they fill in data. How they feel, what symptoms they have, 
          the activity they did and more. For this project we wanted to combine all 
          the data in an easy app so you have a nice overview of your progress in time.

          For this project we did a lot of research before making the final product. 
          We went to physiotherapy sessions with our end users 
          (people with breast cancer). We made a lot of mind-maps, collected data 
          and wrote ux-flows. After that we tested our design with end users and 
          improved it in multiple iterations.
