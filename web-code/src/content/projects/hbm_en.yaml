          For my graduation assignment of the bachelor Multimedia, Concepting and Design 
          I worked for Hans Boodt Mannequins on behalf of Snakeware. Snakeware is a Digital 
          Agency from Sneek and a client of them is Hans Boodt Mannequins (HBM).
           Hans Boodt Mannequins designs, produces and sells contemporary, powerful 
           display figures or mannequins. 
          <br><br>
          HBM customers are largely brand-conscious retailers or visual merchandisers. 
          For them it is often difficult to imagine what the mannequin will look like in real life. 
          Creating and producing mannequins is an expensive and time-consuming task. 
          As a client and as a customer you want to prevent that it will cost extra time and money. 
          You want to minimize the risk of bad shopping. 
          It is therefore important that the customer has as good view of the mannequin 
          in order to avoid the difference with reality. To solve this problem, 
          HBM started a conversation with Snakeware. They have come up with the 
          idea of an Augmented Reality (AR) app. Virtual images, 
          in this case the mannequins, are added to reality. 
          During this graduation assignment the prototype has been realized. 
          In this graduation assignment the following question is answered:

          “In what way can **Augmented Reality** contribute to a more **efficient assessment of mannequins** 
          using a **digital interactive product**?”

          Customers weigh the benefits and sacrifices of a product against each other. 
          The trick is to maximize the benefits and make the sacrifice as small as possible, 
          hat the customer sees a great customer value of the product. In many situations 
          the sacrifices are decisive in the customer's choice process. 
          The choice must therefore be made as simple as possible for the user.
          </p>
          <p>
          Mistakes are often made during the decision-making process, the customer would have 
          wanted to make a different choice afterwards. Therefore, the design must ensure that 
          the customer can make as few mistakes as possible. What can also help with this is to 
          provide the customer with sufficient information about the product, 
          that a good choice can be made. 
          </p>

          The fashion industry is developing at lightning speed. 
          One of the latest trends is large font combined with small font. You can also dare with colors. 
          Bright colors are used and gradients are in. In the fashion industry, much more minimalist design is also applied.
          </p>
          <p>
          Simple streamlined design is easy to understand for the user, it looks nice and gives the designer 
          the space to play with little content. Animations are increasingly included in the design and increase 
          user friendliness. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The user must be able to orient himself well in AR. He always has to be able to "see" 
          something and the scale of the design must be clear. It must be taken into account that the design 
          remains intuitive and is familiar. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Augmented Reality is a fairly new technique, 
          for which not many design guidelines have yet been drawn up. What is important is that 
          we look at the 'real world'. We are used to seeing this and if the design responds the 
          'real world', it becomes easier to understand for the user. Instructions and instructions 
          can help with this. If the design contains 360 degrees and depth, it looks more like the 
          'real world' and the Augmented Reality experience is experienced as real and comfortable.
