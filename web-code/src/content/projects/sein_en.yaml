          SEIN is the centre of expertise for epilepsy and sleep healthcare. 
          Together with a UX Designer I was allowed to completely recreate the website. 
          For this target audience we really needed to make clear that it was readable, 
          clean and peaceful. This website was completely made during the pandemic. 
          So we did all the presentations online with the client and unfortunately I have never visited SEIN myself.
