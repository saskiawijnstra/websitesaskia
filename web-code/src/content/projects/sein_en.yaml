          Human Software - TwinQels makes conversations in organisations easier and better. 
          Employees work with an app that supports reflection, development and job satisfaction. 
          TwinQels offers the basis for self-direction. In this way, employers can have conversations 
          with well-prepared employees who know what they want. In addition, 
          there is an (anonymous) dashboard for HR with relevant HR analytics. 
          Organisations know what is going on and can take action on this.
