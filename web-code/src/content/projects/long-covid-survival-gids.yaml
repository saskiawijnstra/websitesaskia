          In October 2020 I got covid. As others recovered after approximately two weeks I didn’t. 
          I was completely cold. You could put a heating lamp on me and all blankets around me, but 
          I couldn’t get warm. I had no energy. Exhaustion is an understatement. For three months 
          I didn’t had smell or taste, they luckily came back. But other symptoms became worse. 
          I couldn’t handle any stimuli, sound, light etc. 
          The first year I still tried to work for 50%, but that became too much. I tried all kinds of treatments, 
          physio, ergo, multiple rehabilitations, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, H.E.L.P. 
          Apheresis, too much to write down. But my symptoms (a list of two pages long) became worse. 
          I went from bed to couch. Showering, making food, 5 meters walking was too much. My body was empty.
          <br><br>
          To still make some designs I started an instagram page. Low key for fellow sufferers. 
          To help each other and get compassion about long covid. I got a lot of comments, 
          felt the connection with others in my isolation and it gave me a little bit of meaning.

          In 2023 I found the book; Weg van de Pijn - Saskia de Bruin. 
          Other people with long covid or with chronic symptoms had recovered using the tms/mind body method. 
          When I read it a lot fell into place. I felt resistance, but more curiosity for this method. 
          I felt symptoms go away when I applied it. It went with learning, ups and downs, 
          but I finally had found something that worked for me. I went to a retreat from 
          Nina Bosselaar (Lief Klein Leven) and followed a masterclass from Howard Schubiner (Neuroscientists). 
          I read the book; The way out - Alan Gordon. I fully immersed myself in the mind body method. 
          Did and still do yin yoga for relaxation. And step by step made my world bigger again by building new neural pathways.
