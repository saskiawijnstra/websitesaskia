          In October 2020 I got covid. As others recovered after approximately two weeks I didn’t. 
          I was completely cold. You could put a heating lamp on me and all blankets around me, but 
          I couldn’t get warm. I had no energy. Exhaustion is an understatement. For three months 
          I didn’t had smell or taste, they luckily came back. But other symptoms became worse. 
          I couldn’t handle any stimuli, sound, light etc. 
          The first year I still tried to work for 50%, but that became too much. I tried all kinds of treatments, 
          physio, ergo, multiple rehabilitations, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, H.E.L.P. 
          Apheresis, too much to write down. But my symptoms (a list of two pages long) became worse. 
          I went from bed to couch. Showering, making food, 5 meters walking was too much. My body was empty.
          <br><br>
          To still make some designs I started an instagram page. Low key for fellow sufferers. 
          To help each other and get compassion about long covid. I got a lot of comments, 
          felt the connection with others in my isolation and it gave me a little bit of meaning.

          In 2023 I found the book; Weg van de Pijn - Saskia de Bruin. 
          Other people with long covid or with chronic symptoms had recovered using the tms/mind body method. 
          When I read it a lot fell into place. I felt resistance, but more curiosity for this method. 
          I felt symptoms go away when I applied it. It went with learning, ups and downs, 
          but I finally had found something that worked for me. I went to a retreat from 
          Nina Bosselaar (Lief Klein Leven) and followed a masterclass from Howard Schubiner (Neuroscientists). 
          I read the book; The way out - Alan Gordon. I fully immersed myself in the mind body method. 
          Did and still do yin yoga for relaxation. And step by step made my world bigger again by building new neural pathways.

          Right now I am recovered from long covid. Healthy and full of energy. 
          But still building up work and sports. Applying the mind body method as I go. 
          I am super thank-full for finding this method. And proud of the courage and 
          perseverance I have to find the trust in my body and myself back. 
          On my instagram page you can find this journey and the insights 
          I had along the way. Design way’s it is clean, simple, open and soft. 
          Easy to read. Insightful with the illustrations. 
          If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
